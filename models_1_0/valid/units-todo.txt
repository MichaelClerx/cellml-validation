Todo:

Add file that's invalid if a variable references a model unit, but valid if
the local component unit is referenced (both units should have the same name).

This is the final test for 5.4.1.2

although a <units> element in a <component> element
may share the same name as a <units> element in the parent <model> element. In this case, the
units definition in the <component> element supercedes the model-wide definition when
referenced inside that component.
