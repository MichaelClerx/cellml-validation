# Reports

The reports listed below were automatically generated during testing.

Some care needs to be taken when interpreting these results, as (1) many tools don't implement the full spec, and omit e.g. reactions; (2) some tools are more strict or choose to correct errors in the specifications; and (3) some of the tools included are not aimed specifically at validation.
Percentages shown are for the number of test files that were classified correctly - note that this does not necessarily correlate with the "percentage of the spec" a validation method tests, and certainly not with the number of errors a method will catch in the wild.
